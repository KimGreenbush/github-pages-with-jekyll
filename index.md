# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about ...

What I've learned using this GitHub Pages tutorial.

## Step 1: 
Create an `index.md` file for the *homepage*

## Step 2:
Congirure `_config.yml` file to set metadata in the header

## Step 3:
Learn GitHub flow -> commit changes to new branch for editing, then merge back to main when all changes are complete.
