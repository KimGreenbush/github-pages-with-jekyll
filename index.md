# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about ...

What I've learned using this GitHub Pages tutorial.

## Step 1: 
Create an `index.md` file for the *homepage*

## Step 2:
Congirure `_config.yml` file to set metadata in the header

## Step 3:
Learn GitHub flow -> commit changes to new branch for editing, then merge back to main when all changes are complete.

## Step 4:
Add *Front Matter* to an individual page to control variables on that page.

## Step 5: 
Observing how new pages are added to the layout. 
* Questions:
  * How to change the rendered navigation?
  * How and where are certain variable being carried over to? I noticed some repetition I didn't add.
  * How to create/format my own links?
